# T4_motion_detection_model

In this repository I implement a motion detection model for the direction selective cell T4 in the _Drosophila_ visual system. 
This model is published by Zavatone-Veth et al., 2020 and here I implement it in python as part of my master's module at JGU, Mainz.

To use this model, make sure you have created a new environemnt in which you install the packages in the available .yaml file.
Next, you can explore direction selectivity under different stimulation modalities in the main scripts.
